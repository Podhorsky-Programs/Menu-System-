This program is a basic menu system that uses a variety of functions to make a menu system dependent onuser inputs. Users may select optionns from the list of commands and the program will give them the desired output by pulling a function.
This was originly created for a school project but i have since made modifications to it for personal use and for those of you at MIT. Please enjoy :)
